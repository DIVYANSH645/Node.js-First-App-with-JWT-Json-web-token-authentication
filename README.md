This code is a basic implementation of a user authentication system using Express.js, MongoDB, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), and bcrypt for password hashing. Let's break it down step by step:

Imports: The code imports necessary modules such as express, path, mongoose for MongoDB object modeling, cookie-parser for handling cookies, jsonwebtoken for generating and verifying JWTs, and bcrypt for password hashing.

Database Connection: It connects to the MongoDB database named "backend" running on localhost (127.0.0.1) at port 27017.

User Schema: Defines a schema for the user data, including fields like name, email, and password. This schema is used to create a MongoDB model named User.

Express App Setup: Initializes an Express application.

Middlewares Setup:

express.static: Serves static files from the "public" directory.
express.urlencoded: Parses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads.
cookieParser: Parses cookies attached to the client request.
View Engine Setup: Configures the Express app to use EJS (Embedded JavaScript) as the view engine.

Authentication Middleware: Defines a middleware function named isAuthenticated that checks for the presence of a JWT in the cookie. If the token is present, it verifies the token and fetches the user details from the database. If the user is authenticated, it calls the next() function to proceed; otherwise, it redirects the user to the login page.

Routes:

/: The home route. It requires authentication (using the isAuthenticated middleware) and renders a logout page with the user's name.
/login: Renders the login page.
/register: Renders the registration page.
POST /login: Handles user login. It verifies the user's credentials, generates a JWT if the credentials are correct, and sets the token in a cookie before redirecting to the home page.
POST /register: Handles user registration. It creates a new user in the database with hashed password and generates a JWT for the new user.
/logout: Clears the authentication token by setting it to null and redirects the user to the home page.
Server Start: Starts the Express server listening on port 5000.

This code provides a simple authentication system with user registration, login, and logout functionality using Express, MongoDB, JWT, and bcrypt for password hashing. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern where routes are the controllers, views are rendered using EJS, and the database operations are handled by Mongoose models.
